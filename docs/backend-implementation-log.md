    - Text/page indexing: generated tsvector + GIN and trigram index.
  - backend/api/core/config.py: Added DATABASE_SSL_MODE and DATABASE_CONNECT_TIMEOUT settings.
  - backend/api/core/db.py: Added SQLAlchemy connect_args for sslmode and connect_timeout.
  - backend/.env.example: Added Azure PostgreSQL connection examples and SSL mode guidance.
  - backend/requirements.txt: Fixed typo pydanti to pydantic.
- Verification:
  - Python compile check passed for api/core.
- Next:
