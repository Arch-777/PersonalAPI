- Verification:
  - Python compile check passed for full api package.
  - No lint/compile errors reported for Step 5 router files.
- Next:

## Integration Contract Notes for Person 2

### 1. Connector Sync Trigger Contract
- Endpoint: POST /v1/connectors/{platform}/sync
- Auth: Bearer JWT required (current user scope).
- Request body: none.
- Response (success):
  - status: sync_queued
  - platform: {platform}
- Queue task naming expected from workers:
  - gmail -> workers.google_worker.sync_gmail
  - drive -> workers.google_worker.sync_drive
  - whatsapp -> workers.whatsapp_worker.sync_whatsapp
  - notion -> workers.notion_worker.sync_notion
  - spotify -> workers.spotify_worker.sync_spotify

### 2. Chat Endpoint Contract (for Person 2 chat implementation)
- Endpoint target: POST /v1/chat/message
- Auth: Bearer JWT required.
- Request payload:
  - message: string (1..8000)
  - session_id: string | null
- Response payload shape:
  - session_id: string
  - answer: string
  - sources: array of { id, type, source, score, preview }
  - documents: array of string
  - file_links: array of string

### 3. WebSocket Event Envelope Contract
- Endpoint target: /ws or /v1/ws (final path to be confirmed by Person 2 ws router).
- Auth: user-scoped session/token validation.
- Event envelope (recommended stable shape):
  - event: string
  - timestamp: ISO-8601 string
  - user_id: UUID string
  - data: object
- Minimum events required for frontend hooks:
  - sync.started: { platform, connector_id, task_id }
  - sync.progress: { platform, connector_id, processed, total }
  - sync.completed: { platform, connector_id, items_upserted, embedded }
  - sync.failed: { platform, connector_id, error }

### 4. Search/Item Data Contract Used by Person 1 Routers
- Item mapped attribute names in ORM:
  - metadata_json (DB column: metadata)
- Search router expects row fields:
  - id, type, source, summary, content, metadata, item_date, score
- Schemas currently used by Person 1 routers:
  - ItemResponse, PaginatedItemsResponse, SearchResponse, SearchResult

### 5. Developer API Key Contract for Agent Integrations
- Endpoints:
  - POST /v1/developer/api-keys
  - GET /v1/developer/api-keys
  - POST /v1/developer/api-keys/{api_key_id}/revoke
- Storage behavior:
  - key_hash is SHA-256 hash of raw key.
  - raw key returned once on create response only.
  - allowed_channels and agent_type fields available for channel/agent restrictions.

## Current Status
- Person 1 progress through Step 6 is completed.
- Person 1 scope for planned Steps 1-6 is complete and ready for Person 2 integration.
